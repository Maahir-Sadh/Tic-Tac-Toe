# Tic-Tac-Toe
The game most of us have played as kids; and which is known by many names.
The game is quite simple. You and your friend/opponent place the **O** or the **X** symbols to try and fill a column/row/diagonal with all of the same symbol to win.
I have also taken the liberty to have an 'extension' of the game, which is just a larger grid.
